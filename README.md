# Salary-vs-Experience-Prediction-SLR

This is a simple Machine Learning model by using simple linear regression. 

In the dataset we have the infomation about salary and the experience. With this machine learning model, it has been practiced to identify the correlation between salary and experience.
visualizing graphs will show you how they predict the salary according to the experience.

blue line is the prediction regression and red/purple lines are the real values.

Since this is the simple linear regression there are some diviation between actual results and the predicted results. However some predictions are exactly same as the real result.

So enjoy my first machine learning model
